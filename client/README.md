> Client for insubuy code challenge

This is my attempt at the Insubuy code challenge.

It does have basic validation and the page is basically there but styling leaves something to be desired.

I didn't have time to get to the second page.

I was planning on sending the request over to Vuex for async to the server to return all the quotes, style and format that info and inject into a new page.

Thanks for the opportunity.
